# Maze-Game
A game where the player collects gems and avoids an enemy throughout mazes



Overview: 
	This program is a maze game. There are five mazes (levels), that consist of a player (blue pixel), an enemy (red pixel),several gems (green pixels), and an exit (orange pixel) for each maze. The Player must use W,A,S,D to move their player in the respective direction. When the player does make a move the enemy also move in the same direction but moves twice in the respective direction. If the player gets caught by the enemy its game over. Only the player can collect gems, so the enemy is not allowed to land on the gems. To get through the maze the player must collect all the gems, so they are able to get through the exit. At any given time if you want to quit press the spacebar.

Warning:
	When playing be careful not to spam keyboard inputs.
